# Dataverse MCP Use Cases

The **Dataverse MCP** (Machine-Connectable Protocol) enables automated tools and LLM agents to explore and analyze the global Dataverse data network.

## 🚀 Onboarding: Before You Start

To get started, complete onboarding at:

👉 **https://mcp.dataverse.org**

This prepares your agent or system to interact with the MCP tools programmatically.

## 📘 Real-World Use Cases

### 1. 🔍 Discover Topics
**Q:** “How many datasets on *climate change* exist globally?”  
→ Use `search_datasets` across multiple hosts.

### 2. 🗺 Map Installations
**Q:** “Which countries added Dataverse installations since 2015?”  
→ Use `overview`, group by `country` and `created_at`.

### 3. 🧾 ML Metadata
Convert datasets to [Croissant ML](https://mlcroissant.org) format using `get_croissant_record`.

### 4. 📁 File Type Audits
Explore file formats in a dataset using `datatool`.

### 5. 📈 Regional Stats
Get dataset counts per year or per node using `overview_datasets`.

### 6. 🏛 Institutional Comparison
Compare dataset counts for institutions like Harvard vs. Johns Hopkins.

### 7. 🔗 Domain Linking
Combine datasets from different disciplines (e.g., linguistics + demographics).

### 8. 🧠 Dataset Recommendations
**Use Case:** "Gender inequality in education"
- Education Dataverse (CEM)
- UNESCO-UIS Education
- NCES (U.S. education stats)
- Politics & Gender Dataverse

Search using queries like `"gender gap education"`.

### 9. 🧺 Batch Processing
Download and convert all datasets in a topic using `search_datasets` + `get_croissant_record`.

### 10. 📊 Build Dashboards
Generate file-level stats from a host using `overview_files`.
